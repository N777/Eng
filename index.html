            <h2>What is air pollution?</h2>
            <p>
              Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach
              harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. Its effects can
              range from higher disease risks to rising temperatures. Soot,
              smoke, mold, pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide are a just few
              examples of common pollutants.

            <h2>A global health hazard</h2>
            <p>
              Poor air quality kills people. Worldwide, bad outdoor air caused
              an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016, about 90
              percent of them in low- and middle-income countries, according to
              the World Health Organization. Indoor smoke is an ongoing health
              threat to the 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes by
              burning biomass, kerosene, and coal. Air pollution has been linked
              to higher rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory
              diseases such as asthma. In the U.S. nearly 134 million
              people—over 40 percent of the population—are at risk of disease
              and premature death because of air pollution, according to
              American Lung Association estimates.

            <h2>Environmental impacts</h2>
            <p>
              Though many living things emit carbon dioxide when they breathe,
              the gas is widely considered to be a pollutant when associated
              with cars, planes, power plants, and other human activities that
              involve the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline and natural
              gas. That's because carbon dioxide is the most common of the
              greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute
              to climate change. Humans have pumped enough carbon dioxide into
              the atmosphere over the past 150 years to raise its levels higher
              than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years.

              Other greenhouse gases include methane —which comes from such
              sources as landfills, the natural gas industry, and gas emitted by
              livestock—and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were used in
              refrigerants and aerosol propellants until they were banned in the
              late 1980s because of their deteriorating effect on Earth's ozone
              layer.

              Another pollutant associated with climate change is sulfur
              dioxide, a component of smog. Sulfur dioxide and closely related
              chemicals are known primarily as a cause of acid rain. But they
              also reflect light when released in the atmosphere, which keeps
              sunlight out and creates a cooling effect. Volcanic eruptions can
              spew massive amounts of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere,
              sometimes causing cooling that lasts for years. In fact, volcanoes
              used to be the main source of atmospheric sulfur dioxide; today,
              people are.

              Airborne particles, depending on their chemical makeup, can also
              have direct effects separate from climate change. They can change
              or deplete nutrients in soil and waterways, harm forests and
              crops, and damage cultural icons such as monuments and statues.

            <h2>What can be done?</h2>
            <p>
              Countries around the world are tackling various forms of air
              pollution. China, for example, is making strides in cleaning up
              smog-choked skies from years of rapid industrial expansion, partly
              by closing or canceling coal-fired power plants. In the U.S.,
              California has been a leader in setting emissions standards aimed
              at improving air quality, especially in places like famously hazy
              Los Angeles. And a variety of efforts aim to bring cleaner cooking
              options to places where hazardous cookstoves are prevalent.

              In any home, people can safeguard against indoor air pollution by
              increasing ventilation, testing for radon gas, using air
              purifiers, running kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans, and avoiding
              smoking. When working on home projects, look for paint and other
              products low in volatile organic compounds: organizations such as
              Green Seal, UL (GREENGUARD), and the U.S. Green Building Council
              can help.

              To curb global warming, a variety of measures need to be taken,
              such as adding more renewable energy and replacing gasoline-fueled
              cars with zero-emissions vehicles such as electric ones. On a
              larger scale, governments at all levels are making commitments to
              limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The
              Paris Agreement, ratified on November 4, 2016, is one effort to
              combat climate change on a global scale. And the Kigali Amendment
              seeks to further the progress made by the Montreal Protocol,
              banning heat-trapping hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in addition to
              CFCs.
